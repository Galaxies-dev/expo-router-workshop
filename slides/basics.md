# Expo Router Basics
- Every file inside `app` becomes a page
- Layouts (`_layout`) define your page structure
- Create Expo Router apps with the CLI:

`npx create-expo-app myapp -t tabs`

---
# Exercise 1: Stack
- Copy the `1-1/_layout.tsx` to your `app/` folder

# Exercise 2: Tabs
- Create a `tabs` folder inside `app/`
- Copy the `1-2/_layout.tsx` to your `app/tabs` folder

# Exercise 3: Drawer
- Create a `drawer` folder inside `app/`
